Game of Life

Use:

In order to use my version of the Game of Life you have to press the START button FIRST.  Due to a shortage on the time I was able to work on the project, I was unable to remove the prepopulated cells and add the initialization to the main method of the program.

NEXT runs the algorithm on all cells

RESET clears the grid

**Sorry the code is a little messy and not as efficient as possible.  There also might be some debugging code left in the program, but it does not affect the outcome or the algorithm.
